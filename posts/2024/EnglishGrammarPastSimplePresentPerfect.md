I used to struggle with the differences between past simple and present for my years. Let me try to sum up what I learnt recently.

### Completed actions in the past

> I studied for my exam yesterday.

_The studying is finished now._

> She visited France last summer.

_The visit is over._

> We bought a new car in 2022.

_The buying happened and is not ongoing._

### Specific points in the past

> At 8:00 PM, they left for the party.

_Specific time frame in the past_

> In 2005, the hurricane hit the coast.

_Specific historical event_

### Habits or repeated actions in the past

> I used to go to the gym every day.

_The habit stopped before now_

> She always wore red on Fridays.

_Repeated action in the past_

## Present Perfect

### Actions starting in the past and continuing to the present

I have lived here for ten years. (Living started in the past and continues now)

She has written three books. (Writing started in the past and is ongoing)

### Actions finished in the past but with a present connection

I have lost my phone. (The phone is lost now, due to an action in the past)

We have eaten already. (We are not hungry now, because we ate in the past)

### Unspecified time in the past

I have seen that movie before. (Doesn't matter when I saw it)

She has never been to Japan. (No specific time mentioned)

## More Examples

The train departed at 10:00 AM.

_Specific time in the past_

We have traveled by train many times.

_Started in the past, still relevant now_

> I lost my keys yesterday.

_Finished action in the past_

> I have lost my keys, so I can't find them.

_Lost in the past, affects the present_

## Tips

1.  Past simple uses a verb form like "studied," "visited," "bought." while present perfect uses "have/has" + past participle (studied, visited, bought).
2.  If you have a specific time in mind, use past simple.
3.  If the action started in the past and has some relevance to the present, use present perfect.
