I just watched the TED talk titled the same as this article. It really inspired me.

### Bad Habits
This TED talk by Julian Treasure is about the power of communication and how to speak in a way that people want to listen. Treasure argues that the way we speak is often ineffective and hinders our ability to connect with others. He outlines seven bad habits, or "deadly sins" of speaking, that we should avoid:
- Gossip: Speaking negatively about someone who is not present.
- Judging: Making critical judgments about others during a conversation.
- Negativity: Being constantly negative or complaining.
- Excuses: Blaming others and not taking responsibility for your actions.
- Embroidery: Exaggerating or embellishing the truth.
- Lying: Intentionally deceiving others.
- Dogmatism: Confusing facts with opinions and presenting them as absolute truths.

### Good Habits
Treasure also provides four positive habits, which he calls the "HAIL" method, that will improve the way you communicate:
- Honesty: Being truthful and straightforward in your communication.-
- Authenticity: Being yourself and expressing yourself genuinely.
- Integrity: Following through on your commitments and being trustworthy.
- Love: Wishing well for others and communicating with kindness.

Treasure also emphasizes the importance of vocal variety. He recommends using different vocal techniques such as registry, timbre, prosody, pace, pitch, and volume to keep your audience engaged. Finally, he suggests some vocal warm-up exercises to improve your voice before an important presentation. 

Afterwards, I thought about one of the bad habit: judging. It seems that it's very hard to totally avoid juding during our daily work. Especially you are managers or supervisors, completely avoiding judgement in all situations can be unrealistic. I talked about it with my friend. Here's how to navigate giving feedback while minimizing judgement:

### Avoid Judging
- Focus on behavior, not character: Instead of saying "You're unreliable," focus on specific actions, like "Missing deadlines on the last two projects has caused delays."
- Use data and observations: Base your feedback on concrete evidence, not assumptions.
- Separate intent from impact: Focus on the impact the behavior has, not why you think the person did it.
- Use "I" statements: Express how the behavior affects you or the team, like "When deadlines are missed, it puts extra pressure on everyone."
- Offer solutions and support: Help the person improve by suggesting resources or strategies.

### 360 Reviews
When it comes to making 360 Reviews for your team members, it's a great tool to get feedback from multiple sources. Here's how to approach them constructively:
- Focus on growth: Frame the feedback as an opportunity for the person to learn and develop.
- Use a mix of perspectives: Incorporate positive feedback from colleagues with areas for improvement.
- Maintain confidentiality: Keep individual names anonymous while sharing general trends.
- Develop an action plan: Work with the employee to create a plan to address the feedback.
- By focusing on behavior, using data, and offering support, you can deliver constructive feedback that minimizes judgement and encourages growth.

### Dogmatism
In addition, we talked about dogmatism, and found that dogmatism is essentially clinging to beliefs or ideas as absolute truths, refusing to consider alternative viewpoints or evidence that might contradict them. It's like viewing the world through a narrow lens, shutting out anything that doesn't fit your perspective.

Here are some key signs of dogmatic behavior:
- Dismissing opposing views outright: A dogmatic person might shut down conversations with phrases like "That's just wrong" or "You don't understand" without engaging in the other person's reasoning.
- Treating opinions as facts: Presenting personal beliefs as undeniable truths, leaving no room for discussion. For example, someone might say, "The best way to manage a team is with a strict hierarchy," without acknowledging other effective leadership styles.
- Being unwilling to learn or change: Dogmatic individuals might resist new information or experiences that challenge their existing beliefs.

There are some real-life examples:
- Debates on Social Media: Online platforms can be breeding grounds for dogmatism. People might fiercely defend their opinions, resorting to personal attacks instead of constructive arguments.
- Political Discussions: Political beliefs can be deeply personal, leading to dogmatic stances. People might demonize those with opposing views, hindering productive dialogue.
- Scientific Controversies: Even in science, some hold onto outdated theories despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This can slow down progress and hinder the pursuit of truth.

Dogmatism can have negative consequences for individuals and societies:
- Hinders critical thinking: By refusing to consider alternatives, individuals miss out on opportunities to learn and grow.
Stalls progress: Dogmatism in institutions can prevent them from adapting to changing circumstances.
- Breeds conflict: When people hold onto rigid beliefs, it can lead to intolerance and division.
The Importance of Open-Mindedness:

The opposite of dogmatism is open-mindedness. This is the willingness to consider new ideas and perspectives, even if they challenge your existing beliefs.  An open-minded approach allows for:
- Deeper understanding: By considering different viewpoints, you can gain a more nuanced understanding of complex issues.
- Personal growth: Being open to new ideas allows you to learn and adapt throughout your life.
- Stronger relationships: Open-mindedness fosters empathy and understanding, leading to more productive interactions with others.

Speaking of 4 good habits, I just confused about honesty and integrity, they look very similar. I also talked about them with my friend. Honesty and integrity are closely related, but there's a subtle difference between them. Here's a breakdown to clear things up, along with real-life examples:

### Honesty
- Focuses on Truthfulness: Honesty is about being truthful and sincere in your words and actions. It means telling the truth even when it's difficult or inconvenient.
- Example 1: You find a wallet on the street with money and ID inside. Honesty would compel you to return it to the owner.
- Example 2: You're applying for a job and are asked about your experience. Honesty means being truthful about your skills and qualifications, even if they're not exactly what the employer is looking for.

### Integrity
- Goes Beyond Truthfulness: Integrity is a broader concept that encompasses honesty but adds a layer of consistency and adherence to strong moral principles. It's about acting in accordance with what you believe is right, even when no one is watching.
- Example 1: A manager consistently treats all employees fairly, regardless of personal preferences. This shows integrity because fairness is a core principle for them.
- Example 2: You see a colleague taking credit for someone else's work. Even though it might not directly affect you, speaking up about it demonstrates integrity because you believe in honesty and fairness.

Here's an analogy to understand the difference:
Imagine honesty as a single ingredient, like flour. Integrity is like a cake recipe. It uses honesty (flour) along with other ingredients (moral principles) to create a complete and consistent product (your actions and decisions).

It's really a nice TED, I hope you can learn something from it.
