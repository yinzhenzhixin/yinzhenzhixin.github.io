```
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on (not required)
```

2.set the Remote root directory (agent configuration) as your user root directory, e.g. /Users/bma rather than othersï¼Œunless there will be errors like "An unexpected error occurred while trying to open file remoting.jar"

3\. sometimes, if you want someone to access a certain http-server with your local IP, you should make sure the sharing permission get opened
