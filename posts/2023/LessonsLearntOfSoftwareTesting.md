1.  When performing local testing, consider mocking as many test data that real users created as possible. Don't only rely on the data that you created by yourself.
2.  Regression testing should be considered before the product release but the testing strategies should differ with the one that you followed during the feature testing. The later one focuses more on the components internally while the former one focuses more on the integration between the components. i.e Test more as real users behavior and pay more attention on the entire workflow.
3.  Automation tests will only be valuable upon they got executed. Don't lock them in the box for a long time.
4.  Keep an eye on the areas where haven't been reported much defects for a long time. Try to transform your test strategy and let the test effort spent on the most worth scope.
5.  Involve something like showcase from developers so that they can help team uncover issues with regards to test data and test environment ASAP
6.  At the moment when you are aware of the risk of lack of manpower, rather than the last moment, you have to get the external resources ready to get familiar with the project
7.  Automate the tests that most essential and most frequently used by users and testers, like smoking test cases
8.  Automation testing environment should be isolated with manual testing environment
