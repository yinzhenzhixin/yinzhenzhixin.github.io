I'm posting this blog to introduce some basic usage of the present continuous and present simple grammar in English. Many of you might think that English grammar is not important in our daily lives, especially in situations where grammar doesn't matter. However, I believe it is quite important to be aware of the essential points of those essential grammars in English. Let's talk about them one by one in the following months.

This time let's start with the present continuous tense. Most often, this tense is used to describe actions happening at the time of speaking. However, it can also be used to talk about things happening within a specific period around the time of speaking. For examples:
> You are working hard today.
> Susan is working from home this week.

In the two sentences above, things are happening in the current day or week. The periods are around the moment. Here's another good example:
> Jim is reading an interesting book at the moment. He told Susan that he will lend it to her when he has finished it.

Now, let's move on to the present simple tense. I won't spend too much time on this because it's a very basic tense. It's used for things in general or things that happen repeatedly. There are just two similar expressions you need to pay attention to. 

> I'm always losing things.

> I always lose things.

Note the former indicates that you lose things too often but not every time, whereas the later means you lose things always.

I hope this blog has helped you understand the basic usage of the present continuous and present simple tenses in English. Stay tuned for more grammar points in my upcoming blogs!
